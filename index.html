    <p>
        For this piece, I wanted to use a scientific concept to create an engaging and intriguing interaction. ‘Simulated Shadows’ is a playful piece with scope to surprise and delight the audience as they engage in the artistic and technical experience.

    This interactive sculpture use an Arduino to direct fifteen motors controlled by motion detected by ultrasonic sensors. Attached to each motor are two circular linear polarising films, one of which is controlled by the rotation of the motor whilst the other is fixed in place. As the piece is approached, one filter rotate more and more slowly blocking all the light. The long row of these filters allows the user to walk along, leaving a shadow behind them.
