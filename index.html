      "Simulated Shadow" is a playful, interactive piece intended to intrigue the viewer by taking a scientific principle and viewing it from an artistic perspective.

      The sculpture uses an Arduino to direct fifteen motors controlled by motion detected by ultrasonic sensors. Attached to each motor are two circular linear polarising films, one of which is controlled by the rotation of the motor whilst the other is fixed in place. As the user interact with the piece the filters rotate, controlling how much light is let through. The long row of these filters allows the user to walk along, leaving a shadow behind them.
