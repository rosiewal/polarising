        This piece is an interactive sculpture that uses an Arduino to control fifteen motors according to the movement detected by the ultrasonic sensors. Attached to each motor are two circular pieces of linear polarising film, one of which is controlled by the rotation of the motor whilst the other is fixed in place. This allows the effect of the darkening circles as the films are rotated from parallel to perpendicular.

        As the piece is approached, the filters slowly turn from translucent to completely opaque. The long row of these filters allows the user to walk along, leaving a shadow behind them. The piece also has two other modes, ripple and dance, which either cause a rippling effect as the user approaches or carries out some preprogrammed movements.
